"In computer science, a binary search tree (BST), also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the node's left subtree and less than those in its right subtree."

This repo contains the basic implementation of Binary Search Tree in JavaScript.

In order to run code, clone the repository, open a terminal in repo directory and run `node index.js`

Note : This project uses ES6 syntax to import and export modules, which requires node.js v12 and above.
